⛪⛪ 🚀🚀👨‍🚀🚀 🥇🥇 Golden Nuggets 🥇🥇As a Red Teamer it is easier to build a multi-dimensional web cloud environment with Blue_Prints.  It is easier to travel when you know where you are going and which ports are open to "iffonfig" and then run a nmap and look out because I will be coming around the mountain when I come using the reverse shell and very carefully listen and hopefully go undetected.  Hold on, I don't want to leave you hanging.  I then put on my Blue Teamer jacket and Defend at all cost and ALL in a "Good Day's" work and make today just a little safer, more protected trying to maintain the C.I.A triad and uphold mycivil duty as a SSOC to Honor: Protect: Execute: Exploit Vulnerabilities, and mitigate rik and guard against attacks both on land and in the Cloud environment.  Thank you for an amazing Journey. 🙏🙏🙏🙏Thanks be to The All Might God.
